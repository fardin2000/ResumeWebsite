During my time at school ive learned alot about data structures and the tools to make applications, but during my time at school I always made sure to keep my skills topped off by working on personal projects. Some of the skills ive prided myself on are: Javascript, Python, C#, and Java, I have used these languages consistently thorugh the years and Im sure given enough time i can learn even more about them.",
