    "bio":"I am a proud worker and I enjoy working on projects that have passion in them. During my time at school I learned a lot about data structures and the tools to make applications. I have always made sure to keep my skills topped off over the years by working on personal projects. Many of the projects I work on require knowledge of specific programming languages and in order to continue working on them I learned many coding languages, some of the skills I have and still do prided myself on are: Javascript, Python, C#, and Java. I have used these languages consistently throughout the years and Im sure that given enough time I can learn even more about them, including any new libraries that come with time.",
